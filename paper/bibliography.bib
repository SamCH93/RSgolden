abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing has received a great amount of attention in recent years in the light of the reproducibility crisis of science. Recently, there have been calls to retire the dichotomization of study results into “significant” or “not significant” depending on whether the P value crosses some threshold or not. Ways of improving the interpretation of P values and confidence intervals are therefore needed. We illustrate the use of P value functions, which display confidence limits and P values for any confidence level for a parameter. P value functions accessibly display a wealth of information: point estimate for the parameter, one-sided and two-sided confidence limits at any level, and one-sided and two-sided P values for any null and non-null value and the counternull value. Presenting several recent examples from the literature, we show how P value functions can be applied to present evidence and to make informed statistical inferences without resorting to dichotomization. We argue that P value functions are more informative than commonly used summaries of study results such as single P values or confidence intervals. P value functions require minimal retraining, are easily interpreted, and show potential to fix many of the common misinterpretation of P values and confidence intervals. To facilitate the adoption of P value functions, we released an R package for creating P value functions for several commonly used estimates.},

  Abstract                 = {Confidence intervals for a single parameter are spanned by quantiles of a confidence distribution, and one-sided p-values are cumulative confidences. Confidence distributions are thus a unifying format for representing frequentist inference for a single parameter. The confidence distribution, which depends on data, is exact (unbiased) when its cumulative distribution function evaluated at the true parameter is uniformly distributed over the unit interval. A new version of the Neyman-Pearson lemma is given, showing that the confidence distribution based on the natural statistic in exponential models with continuous data is less dispersed than all other confidence distributions, regardless of how dispersion is measured. Approximations are necessary for discrete data, and also in many models with nuisance parameters. Approximate pivots might then be useful. A pivot based on a scalar statistic determines a likelihood in the parameter of interest along with a confidence distribution. This proper likelihood is reduced of all nuisance parameters, and is appropriate for meta-analysis and updating of information. The reduced likelihood is generally different from the confidence density. Confidence distributions and reduced likelihoods are rooted in Fisher-Neyman statistics. This frequentist methodology has many of the Bayesian attractions, and the two approaches are briefly compared. Concepts, methods and techniques of this brand of Fisher-Neyman statistics are presented. Asymptotics and bootstrapping are used to find pivots and their distributions, and hence reduced likelihoods and confidence distributions. A simple form of inverting bootstrap distributions to approximate pivots of the abc type is proposed. Our material is illustrated in a number of examples and in an application to multiple capture data for bowhead whales.},

Numerous \\$p\\$-value combination methods appear in the literature, each with different statistical properties, yet often the final choice used in a meta-analysis can seem arbitrary, as if all effort has been expended in building the models that gave rise to the \\$p\\$-values. Birnbaum (1954) showed that any reasonable \\$p\\$-value combiner must be optimal against some alternative hypothesis. Starting from this perspective and recasting each method of combining \\$p\\$-values as a likelihood ratio test, we present theoretical results for some standard combiners that provide guidance on how a powerful combiner might be chosen in practice.}",

These meetings resulted in opposite decisions by the advisory committee. The crux of the argumentation was the two-positive-trial FDA paradigm. Carvedilol did not meet the usual paradigm because an exercise end point was not statistically different from placebo in three U.S. trials. Most other end points were highly significant, and death, which was monitored across the U.S. program, was different with p < 0.0001. Here we argue that the usual paradigm is very useful but not an absolute principle, that the usual paradigm can sometimes miss the strength of evidence even in the primary end points, and that rational decision making requires on occasion that other evidence must lead to approval. Control of the type I error rate should be taken very seriously, should rarely be violated, and serves the biomedical community well.

	abstract = {The widespread use of Bonferroni correction encumbers the scientific process and wastes opportunities for discovery presented by big data, because it discourages exploratory analyses by overpenalizing the total number of statistical tests performed. In this paper, I introduce the harmonic mean p-value (HMP), a simple to use and widely applicable alternative to Bonferroni correction motivated by Bayesian model averaging that greatly improves statistical power while maintaining control of the gold standard false positive rate. The HMP has a range of desirable properties and offers a different way to think about large-scale exploratory data analysis in classical statistics.Analysis of {\textquotedblleft}big data{\textquotedblright} frequently involves statistical comparison of millions of competing hypotheses to discover hidden processes underlying observed patterns of data, for example, in the search for genetic determinants of disease in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Controlling the familywise error rate (FWER) is considered the strongest protection against false positives but makes it difficult to reach the multiple testing-corrected significance threshold. Here, I introduce the harmonic mean p-value (HMP), which controls the FWER while greatly improving statistical power by combining dependent tests using generalized central limit theorem. I show that the HMP effortlessly combines information to detect statistically significant signals among groups of individually nonsignificant hypotheses in examples of a human GWAS for neuroticism and a joint human{\textendash}pathogen GWAS for hepatitis C viral load. The HMP simultaneously tests all ways to group hypotheses, allowing the smallest groups of hypotheses that retain significance to be sought. The power of the HMP to detect significant hypothesis groups is greater than the power of the Benjamini{\textendash}Hochberg procedure to detect significant hypotheses, although the latter only controls the weaker false discovery rate (FDR). The HMP has broad implications for the analysis of large datasets, because it enhances the potential for scientific discovery.},

abstract = {Abstract In terms of the risk of making a Type I error in evaluating a null hypothesis of equality, requiring two independent confirmatory trials with two-sided p-values less than 0.05 is equivalent to requiring one confirmatory trial with two-sided p-value less than 0.001 25. Furthermore, the use of a single confirmatory trial is gaining acceptability, with discussion in both ICH E9 and a CPMP Points to Consider document. Given the growing acceptance of this approach, this note provides a formula for the sample size savings that are obtained with the single clinical trial approach depending on the levels of Type I and Type II errors chosen. For two replicate trials each powered at 90\%, which corresponds to a single larger trial powered at 81\%, an approximate 19\% reduction in total sample size is achieved with the single trial approach. Alternatively, a single trial with the same sample size as the total sample size from two smaller trials will have much greater power. For example, in the case where two trials are each powered at 90\% for two-sided α=0.05 yielding an overall power of 81\%, a single trial using two-sided α=0.001 25 would have 91\% power.

abstract = {Summary.  Problems of the analysis of data with incomplete observations are all too familiar in statistics. They are doubly difficult if we are also uncertain about the choice of model. We propose a general formulation for the discussion of such problems and develop approximations to the resulting bias of maximum likelihood estimates on the assumption that model departures are small. Loss of efficiency in parameter estimation due to incompleteness in the data has a dual interpretation: the increase in variance when an assumed model is correct; the bias in estimation when the model is incorrect. Examples include non-ignorable missing data, hidden confounders in observational studies and publication bias in meta-analysis. Doubling variances before calculating confidence intervals or test statistics is suggested as a crude way of addressing the possibility of undetectably small departures from the model. The problem of assessing the risk of lung cancer from passive smoking is used as a motivating example.},

abstract="Responding to recent concerns about the reliability of the published literature in psychology and other disciplines, we formed the X-Phi Replicability Project (XRP) to estimate the reproducibility of experimental philosophy (osf.io/dvkpr). Drawing on a representative sample of 40 x-phi studies published between 2003 and 2015, we enlisted 20 research teams across 8 countries to conduct a high-quality replication of each study in order to compare the results to the original published findings. We found that x-phi studies -- as represented in our sample -- successfully replicated about 70{\%} of the time. We discuss possible reasons for this relatively high replication rate in the field of experimental philosophy and offer suggestions for best research practices going forward.",

To validate any inferences drawn it is essential that the inputs chosen be deemed appropriate for the data. In the Bayesian context these inputs consist of both the sampling model and the prior. There are thus two possibilities for failure: the data may not have arisen from the sampling model, or the prior may place most of its mass on parameter values that are not feasible in light of the data (referred to here as prior-data conflict). Failure of the sampling model can only be fixed by modifying the model, while prior-data conflict can be overcome if sufficient data is available. We examine how to assess whether or not a prior-data conflict exists, and how to assess when its effects can be ignored for inferences. The concept of prior-data conflict is seen to lead to a partial characterization of what is meant by a noninformative prior or a noninformative sequence of priors.},

abstract="Well-designed experiments are likely to yield compelling evidence with efficient sample sizes. Bayes Factor Design Analysis (BFDA) is a recently developed methodology that allows researchers to balance the informativeness and efficiency of their experiment (Sch{\"o}nbrodt {\&} Wagenmakers, Psychonomic Bulletin {\&} Review, 25(1), 128--142 2018). With BFDA, researchers can control the rate of misleading evidence but, in addition, they can plan for a target strength of evidence. BFDA can be applied to fixed-N and sequential designs. In this tutorial paper, we provide an introduction to BFDA and analyze how the use of informed prior distributions affects the results of the BFDA. We also present a user-friendly web-based BFDA application that allows researchers to conduct BFDAs with ease. Two practical examples highlight how researchers can use a BFDA to plan for informative and efficient research designs.",

In biomedical research, we are in the midst of a revolution with the generation of new data and scientific publications at a previously unprecedented rate. However, unfortunately, there is compelling evidence that the majority of these discoveries will not stand the test of time. To a large extent, this reproducibility crisis in basic and preclinical research may be as a result of failure to adhere to good scientific practice and the desperation to publish or perish. This is a multifaceted, multistakeholder problem. No single party is solely responsible, and no single solution will suffice. Here we review the reproducibility problems in basic and preclinical biomedical research, highlight some of the complexities, and discuss potential solutions that may help improve research quality and reproducibility.},

abstract="Iverson, Lee, and Wagenmakers (2009) claimed that Killeen's (2005) statistic prep overestimates the ``true probability of replication.'' We show that Iverson et al. confused the probability of replication of an observed direction of effect with a probability of coincidence---the probability that two future experiments will return the same sign. The theoretical analysis is punctuated with a simulation of the predictions of prep for a realistic random effects world of representative parameters, when those are unknown a priori. We emphasize throughout that prep is intended to evaluate the probability of a replication outcome after observations, not to estimate a parameter. Hence, the usual conventional criteria (unbiasedness, minimum variance estimator) for judging estimators are not appropriate for probabilities such as p and prep.",

It combines effect-size estimation with hypothesis testing, assessing the extent to which the replication results are consistent with an effect size big enough to have been detectable in the original study. The approach is demonstrated by examining replications of three well-known findings. Its benefits include the following: (a) differentiating “unsuccessful” replication attempts (i.e., studies yielding p > .05) that are too noisy from those that actively indicate the effect is undetectably different from zero, (b) “protecting” true findings from underpowered replications, and (c) arriving at intuitively compelling inferences in general and for the revisited replications in particular. }

 abstract = {We argue that the Bayesian approach is best seen as providing additional tools for those carrying out health-care evaluations, rather than replacing their traditional methods. A distinction is made between those features that arise from the basic Bayesian philosophy and those that come from the modern ability to make inferences using very complex models. Selected examples of the former include explicit recognition of the wide cast of stakeholders in any evaluation, simple use of Bayes theorem and use of a community of prior distributions. In the context of complex models, we selectively focus on the possible role of simple Monte Carlo methods, alternative structural models for incorporating historical data and making inferences on complex functions of indirectly estimated parameters. These selected issues are illustrated by two worked examples presented in a standardized format. The emphasis throughout is on inference rather than decision-making.},

	abstract = {Objective~To estimate the benefits and harms of using corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for sore throat.Design~Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised control trials.Data sources~Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), trial registries up to May 2017, reference lists of eligible trials, related reviews.Study selection~Randomised controlled trials of the addition of corticosteroids to standard clinical care for patients aged 5 or older in emergency department and primary care settings with clinical signs of acute tonsillitis, pharyngitis, or the clinical syndrome of sore throat. Trials were included irrespective of language or publication status.Review methods~Reviewers identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the evidence, independently and in duplicate. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ~Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including the selection of outcomes important to patients. Random effects model was used for meta-analyses. Quality of evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach.Results~10 eligible trials enrolled 1426 individuals. Patients who received single low dose corticosteroids (the most common intervention was oral dexamethasone with a maximum dose of 10 mg) were twice as likely to experience pain relief after 24 hours (relative risk 2.2, 95\% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.3; risk difference 12.4\%; moderate quality evidence) and 1.5 times more likely to have no pain at 48 hours (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8; risk difference 18.3\%; high quality). The mean time to onset of pain relief in patients treated with corticosteroids was 4.8 hours earlier (95\% confidence interval -1.9 to -7.8; moderate quality) and the mean time to complete resolution of pain was 11.1 hours earlier (-0.4 to -21.8; low quality) than in those treated with placebo. The absolute pain reduction at 24 hours (visual analogue scale 0-10) was greater in patients treated with corticosteroids (mean difference 1.3, 95\% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.9; moderate quality). Nine of the 10 trials sought information regarding adverse events. Six studies reported no adverse effects, and three studies reported few adverse events, which were mostly complications related to disease, with a similar incidence in both groups.Conclusion~Single low dose corticosteroids can provide pain relief in patients with sore throat, with no increase in serious adverse effects. Included trials did not assess the potential risks of larger cumulative doses in patients with recurrent episodes of acute sore throat.Systematic review registration~PROSPERO CRD42017067808.},

    abstract = {The vast majority of published results in the literature is statistically significant, which raises concerns about their reliability. The Reproducibility Project Psychology (RPP) and Experimental Economics Replication Project (EE-RP) both replicated a large number of published studies in psychology and economics. The original study and replication were statistically significant in 36.1% in RPP and 68.8% in EE-RP suggesting many null effects among the replicated studies. However, evidence in favor of the null hypothesis cannot be examined with null hypothesis significance testing. We developed a Bayesian meta-analysis method called snapshot hybrid that is easy to use and understand and quantifies the amount of evidence in favor of a zero, small, medium and large effect. The method computes posterior model probabilities for a zero, small, medium, and large effect and adjusts for publication bias by taking into account that the original study is statistically significant. We first analytically approximate the methods performance, and demonstrate the necessity to control for the original study’s significance to enable the accumulation of evidence for a true zero effect. Then we applied the method to the data of RPP and EE-RP, showing that the underlying effect sizes of the included studies in EE-RP are generally larger than in RPP, but that the sample sizes of especially the included studies in RPP are often too small to draw definite conclusions about the true effect size. We also illustrate how snapshot hybrid can be used to determine the required sample size of the replication akin to power analysis in null hypothesis significance testing and present an easy to use web application (https://rvanaert.shinyapps.io/snapshot/) and R code for applying the method.},

Nonreplication often reflects false positives in the original claims. However, occasionally, nonreplication may be due to heterogeneity due to biases or even genuine diversity of the genetic effects in different populations. Here, we propose methods for estimating the required sample size to replicate an association across many studies with different amounts of between-study heterogeneity, when data are summarized through metaanalysis. We demonstrate thresholds of between-study heterogeneity (τ0 2) above which one cannot reach adequate power to replicate a proposed association at a specified level of statistical significance when k studies are performed (regardless of how large these studies are). Based on empirical evidence from 91 proposed gene{\textendash}disease associations (50 on candidate genes and 41 from genome-wide association efforts), the observed between-study heterogeneity is often close to or even surpasses nonreplicability thresholds. With more modest between-study heterogeneity, the required sample size increases considerably compared with when no between-study heterogeneity exists. Increases are steep as τ0 2 is approached. Therefore, some true associations may not be practically possible to replicate with consistency, no matter how large studies are conducted. Efforts should be made to minimize between-study heterogeneity in targeted genetic effects.},

	abstract = {Objective: To evaluate whether characteristics of pivotal efficacy trials supporting US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of novel therapeutic agents have changed over the past three decades. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting and population: Publicly available data on novel therapeutics approved by the FDA between 1995-1997, 2005-2007, and 2015-2017. Main outcome measures: Use of randomization, blinding, types of comparators and primary endpoints, number of treated patients, and trial duration in pivotal trials supporting novel therapeutic approval, both individually and aggregated by each indication approval. Analyses were repeated stratifying by use of orphan designation and use of special regulatory programs. Results: There were 273 novel therapeutics approved by the FDA in these 3 periods (107 in 1995-1997, 57 in 2005-2007, 109 in 2015-2017), representing 339 indications (157, 64, and 118, respectively). Overall, the proportion of indication approvals supported by at least 2 pivotal trials decreased (80.6\% in 1995-1997, 60.3\% in 2005-2007, 52.8\% in 2015-2017; p\&lt;0.001). The proportion supported by only single-arm pivotal trials increased (4.0\% in 1995-1997, 12.7\% in 2005-2007, 17.0\% in 2015-2017; p=0.001), as did the proportion supported by at least one pivotal trial of 6 months duration (25.8\% in 1995-1997, 34.9\% in 2005-2007, 46.2\% in 2015-2017; p=0.001). When stratified by use of special regulatory programs, pivotal trial characteristics changed over time in divergent ways, both individually and when aggregated by indication approvals. Conclusion: More recent FDA approvals of novel therapeutics were based on fewer pivotal trials, with less rigorous designs but longer trial durations. These findings reinforce the importance of the FDA{\textquoteright}s strategy for requiring ongoing evaluation of therapeutic safety and efficacy after approval.Competing Interest StatementAll authors have completed the Unified Competing Interest form (available on request from the corresponding author) and declare: In the past 36 months, Ms. Zhang received research support as a scholar in the Yale-Mayo Clinic FDA CERSI (U01FD005938) and from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation.

	abstract = {We wish to answer this question: If you observe a {\textquoteleft}significant{\textquoteright} p-value after doing a single unbiased experiment, what is the probability that your result is a false positive? The weak evidence provided by p-values between 0.01 and 0.05 is explored by exact calculations of false positive risks. When you observe p = 0.05, the odds in favour of there being a real effect (given by the likelihood ratio) are about 3 : 1. This is far weaker evidence than the odds of 19 to 1 that might, wrongly, be inferred from the p-value. And if you want to limit the false positive risk to 5\%, you would have to assume that you were 87\% sure that there was a real effect before the experiment was done. If you observe p = 0.001 in a well-powered experiment, it gives a likelihood ratio of almost 100 : 1 odds on there being a real effect. That would usually be regarded as conclusive. But the false positive risk would still be 8\% if the prior probability of a real effect were only 0.1. And, in this case, if you wanted to achieve a false positive risk of 5\% you would need to observe p = 0.00045. It is recommended that the terms {\textquoteleft}significant{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}non-significant{\textquoteright} should never be used. Rather, p-values should be supplemented by specifying the prior probability that would be needed to produce a specified (e.g. 5\%) false positive risk. It may also be helpful to specify the minimum false positive risk associated with the observed p-value. Despite decades of warnings, many areas of science still insist on labelling a result of p \&lt; 0.05 as {\textquoteleft}statistically significant{\textquoteright}. This practice must contribute to the lack of reproducibility in some areas of science. This is before you get to the many other well-known problems, like multiple comparisons, lack of randomization and p-hacking. Precise inductive inference is impossible and replication is the only way to be sure. Science is endangered by statistical misunderstanding, and by senior people who impose perverse incentives on scientists.},

    abstract = { The p-value quantifies the discrepancy between the data and a null hypothesis of interest, usually the assumption of no difference or no effect. A Bayesian approach allows to calibrate p-values by transforming them to direct measures of the evidence against the null hypothesis, so-called Bayes factors. We review the available literature in this area and consider two-sided significance tests for a point null hypothesis in more detail. We distinguish simple from local alternative hypotheses and contrast traditional Bayes factors based on the data with Bayes factors based on p-values or test statistics. A well-known finding is that the minimum Bayes factor, the smallest possible Bayes factor within a certain class of alternative hypotheses, provides less evidence against the null hypothesis than the corresponding p-value might suggest. It is less known that the relationship between p-values and minimum Bayes factors also depends on the sample size and on the dimension of the parameter of interest. We illustrate the transformation of p-values to minimum Bayes factors with two examples from clinical research. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application Volume 5 is March 7, 2018.

abstract="The statistical test of the hypothesis of no difference between the average bioavailabilities of two drug formulations, usually supplemented by an assessment of what the power of the statistical test would have been if the true averages had been inequivalent, continues to be used in the statistical analysis of bioavailability/bioequivalence studies. In the present article, this Power Approach (which in practice usually consists of testing the hypothesis of no difference at level 0.05 and requiring an estimated power of 0.80) is compared to another statistical approach, the Two One-Sided Tests Procedure, which leads to the same conclusion as the approach proposed by Westlake (2) based on the usual (shortest) 1--2$\alpha$ confidence interval for the true average difference. It is found that for the specific choice of $\alpha$=0.05 as the nominal level of the one-sided tests, the two one-sided tests procedure has uniformly superior properties to the power approach in most cases. The only cases where the power approach has superior properties when the true averages are equivalent correspond to cases where the chance of concluding equivalence with the power approach when the true averages are notequivalent exceeds 0.05. With appropriate choice of the nominal level of significance of the one-sided tests, the two one-sided tests procedure always has uniformly superior properties to the power approach. The two one-sided tests procedure is compared to the procedure proposed by Hauck and Anderson (1).",
